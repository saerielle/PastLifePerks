## Description
A lightweight mod that turns maxed-out friendships and job endings into real perks in your next lives.

## Past Life Friendship Buffs
If you maxed out a character's relationship in a past life (earned the in-game achievement for them), Sol remembers. In future lives, all reputation gains from dialogue and gifts with that character are increased:
- +50% rep gain when their relationship is under 50
- +25% rep gain between 50-99
- Birthday gifts (that they like) always get +50% bonus
This bonus helps to skip early grind but doesn't eliminate effort - especially for those latecomer friends (you know the ones). Balance may evolve; I am open to feedback if it feels like too much or too little.

This also works with modded friends - as long as you have reached that friend's ultimate friendship event and got their 3rd card in one of the past lives :)

## Job Memory Stat Bonuses
Sol doesn't just remember feelings. They also remember… competence. If you’ve unlocked a job ending that required a specific stat, your future selves will benefit:
- You start each new life with +5 in that stat
- You gain another +5 mid-game
Max possible: +10 to each stat, if you're a complete job-ending gremlin.
